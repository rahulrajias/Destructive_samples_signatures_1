>>12_mar_2018_000 to 026 is taken from D2R1I2N3 i.e. very first plot of D2. 
  total 27 readings is from 9 subplots of the D2R1. from each plot, one leaf is selceted.
  and three readings are taken form same leaf and then from same leaf nutrition analyser data is also collected.
  the sequence of data collection is like this: I2N3-->I2N2-->I1N1-->I3N3-->I3N2-->I3N1-->I1N2-->I1N3-->I2N1 
  027 to 035 is again from very first subplot of D2R1 (I2N3) but the readings are taken from a plant with leaf at top, middle and
  bottom of the plant respectively. means 027-029 is for top leaf then 3 middle and then bottom. (with destructive sampling)
  
>>036-062 is from D2R2 total 27. data is taken similar to D1R1 but vertical profile is not captured. 
>>063-090 is from D2R3 total 27. pattern is same as above.

>>12_mar_2018_091 to 117 is taken from D3R1I1N2 i.e. very first plot of D3. 
  total 27 readings is from 9 subplots of the D3R1. from each plot, one leaf is selceted and three readings are taken 
  form same leaf and then from same leaf nutrition analyser data is also collected. sequence is similar as mentioned above.
  118 to 126 is again from very first subplot of D3R1 but the readingsa are taken from a plant with leaf at top, middle and
  bottom of the plant respectively. means 118-120 is for top leaf then 3 middle and then bottom. (with destructive sampling)
